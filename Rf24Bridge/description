The bridge:
1. Connects via UDP to OpenHAB2.
2. Manages all the RF24 devices.
 2.1. On init, it scans range of addresses to detect available devices.
 2.2. For each device, list of functions on pins is obtained.
 2.3. For each pin, an item is generated and placed in files in /etc/openhab2/items
 2.4. A sitemap is created in /etc/openhab2/sitemaps that will let the user see what devices are connected. Though this sitemap, user can configure the endpoints (enable/disable, set parameters, e.g. number of digital LED segments connected on a LED driver interface).
